# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. Users can select an algorithm, adjust the array size, and observe the sorting process in real time through animated bars.

## Features
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort.
- **Customizable Array Size:** Enter a specific size for the array (between 3 and 250 elements).
- **Real-Time Timer:** Displays the time taken for the sorting process in milliseconds.
- **Swap Counter:** Tracks and displays the number of swaps performed during sorting.
- **Theme Customization:** Allows users to change the primary color theme of the visualizer.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structure of the application.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout, including Material Design-inspired minimalistic visuals.
- **JavaScript:** Handles sorting logic, animations, and DOM updates.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Instructions
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Use the dropdown menu to select the sorting algorithm.
3. Enter the desired array size using the input box.
4. Click the **Start Animation** button.
5. Observe the sorting process. The timer and swap counter will update in real time.

## Available Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list.
2. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted list one element at a time.
3. **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element.
4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves and merges sorted halves.
5. **Quick Sort**: Selects a pivot and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, sorting recursively.

## Customization
- **Array Size:** The input field allows values between 3 and 250.
- **Theme Color:** The color picker allows changing the primary color of the bars.
